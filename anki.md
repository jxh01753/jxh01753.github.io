# Guide to setting up Anki  
  
Hello. If you are reading this you are likely a student in 黄老师's Chinese class.

## What is Anki?  
Put simply, Anki is a flashcard app. How Anki differs from manual flashcards that you write physcially is that Anki is [Spaced Repetition Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) (SRS). SRS is essentially an algorithm that spaces out flashcards so that they appear just as you are about to forget the content. There is a lot of literature and research on how SRS works, so if you would like to read more on it click the link above to read through the wikipedia page on it.  
  
## Why Anki?  
Anki is very popular with language learners, hobbyists and medical students to help them retain information. Language learners tend to like Anki/SRS because it allows them to learn and retain vocabulary a lot easier than with manual repetition/physical flashcards.  
  
Anki is (mostly) free software. It is available for free on Windows, macOS, Linux and Android, although there is a 25USD fee for the app on iOS devices. (I personally use Anki on macOS and iOS and I honestly would pay for Anki again).
  
Anki has a [huge library of flashcard decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/) for a wide range of topics from Mandarin, English and Korean to Chemistry, Medicine and Physics.   
  
It is very versatile software and can be customised to suit the needs of the user. Because of this, it can be a little intimidating for first time users because there are so many options and ways to customise Anki that it can be overwhelming. I haven't gone too deep into the customisation side of Anki, I have only set up Anki to how I like to use it, so you may find after using it for a little while that you would like things to work differently and Anki allows for that.

## What you need
To follow this guide, you need either -  

* A computer running Windows 7 or later, or a Linux operating system of your choice; or
* An Apple Mac device running macOS 10.13.4 or later;
  
## Getting Anki  
Anki is available from the [Anki website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), the Apple [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387) (iOS) and the Google [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&pli=1) (Android).  

**I really recommend setting this up on a computer first**. Creating flashcards is a **lot** easier on a physical keyboard and computer than it is on a mobile device. If you only have a mobile device, I will discuss more about this at the end.  
  
This guide will show how to setup Anki on macOS, but the instructions are the same for Windows and Linux users. 
  
Navigate to the anki website using the following link - https://apps.ankiweb.net/. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, select the operating system you're using (Windows, macOS or Linux) and download the previous stable release (2.1.49). We need this version because later on we will install the Chinese Support Addon.  
  
## Starting Anki
When you start Anki for the first time, you will be presented with a blank screen and the option to create a deck.

First we're going to install the Chinese Support Addon as this will make creating flashcards a lot easier.
